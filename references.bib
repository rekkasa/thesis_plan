Unfortunately, the word confounding has been used synonymously with several other terms, and it has been used to refer to at least four distinct concepts. This paper provides an overview of confounding and related concepts based on a counterfactual model of causation. In this context, which predominates in nonexperimental research, confounding is a source of bias in the estimation of causal effects. Special attention is given to the history of definitions of confounding, the distinction between confounding and confounders, problems in the control of confounding, the relations of confounding to exchangeability and collapsibility, and confounding in randomized trials.},

		Background—

		Randomized trials comparing fibrinolysis with primary angioplasty for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction have demonstrated a beneficial effect of primary angioplasty on the combined end point of death, reinfarction, and disabling stroke but not on all-cause death. Identifying a patient group with reduced mortality from an invasive strategy would be important for early triage. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score is a simple validated integer score that makes it possible to identify high-risk patients on admission to hospital. We hypothesized that a high-risk group might have a reduced mortality with an invasive strategy.

		Methods and Results—

		We classified 1527 patients from the Danish Multicenter Randomized Study on Fibrinolytic Therapy Versus Acute Coronary Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DANAMI-2) trial with information for all variables necessary for calculating the TIMI risk score as low risk (TIMI risk score, 0 to 4) or high risk (TIMI risk score ≥5) and investigated the effect of primary angioplasty versus fibrinolysis on mortality and morbidity in the 2 groups. Follow-up was 3 years. We classified 1134 patients as low risk and 393 as high risk. There was a significant interaction between risk status and effect of primary angioplasty ( P =0.008). In the low-risk group, there was no difference in mortality (primary angioplasty, 8.0\%; fibrinolysis, 5.6\%; P =0.11); in the high-risk group, there was a significant reduction in mortality with primary angioplasty (25.3\% versus 36.2\%; P =0.02).

		Conclusions—

		Risk stratification at admission based on the TIMI risk score identifies a group of high-risk patients who have a significantly reduced mortality with an invasive strategy of primary angioplasty.

Total fractures were {\textgreater}2 million, costing nearly \$17 billion in 2005. Men account for {\textgreater}25\% of the burden. Rapid growth in the disease burden is projected among nonwhite populations. Introduction: The aging of the U.S. population will likely lead to greater prevalence of osteoporosis. Policy makers require precise projections of the disease burden by demographic subgroups and skeletal sites to effectively target osteoporosis intervention and treatment programs. Materials and Methods: A state transition Markov decision model was used to estimate total incident fractures and costs by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and skeletal site for the U.S. population ≥50 years of age for 2005–2025. Results: More than 2 million incident fractures at a cost of \$17 billion are predicted for 2005. Total costs including prevalent fractures are more than \$19 billion. Men account for 29\% of fractures and 25\% of costs. Total incident fractures by skeletal site were vertebral (27\%), wrist (19\%), hip (14\%), pelvic (7\%), and other (33\%). Total costs by fracture type were vertebral (6\%), hip (72\%), wrist (3\%), pelvic (5\%), and other (14\%). By 2025, annual fractures and costs are projected to rise by almost 50\%. The most rapid growth is estimated for people 65–74 years of age, with an increase {\textgreater}87\%. An increase of nearly 175\% is projected for Hispanic and other subpopulations. Conclusions: Osteoporosis prevention, treatment, and education efforts should address all skeletal sites, not just hip and vertebral, and appropriate attention is warranted for men and diverse race/ethnicity subgroups.},

It describes the burden of common osteoporotic fractures, the associated morbidity and mortality, the clustering of fractures in individuals, and the identification of at-risk groups. It also highlights the development of new algorithms to identify individuals at high risk of fracture, enabling the implementation of appropriate treatment strategies.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments—the use of “negative controls”—is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

In particular, treatment effects may vary systematically by the propensity for treatment. In this paper, we discuss a practical approach to studying heterogeneous treatment effects as a function of the treatment propensity, under the same assumption commonly underlying regression analysis: ignorability. We describe one parametric method and two nonparametric methods for estimating interactions between treatment and the propensity for treatment. For the first method, we begin by estimating propensity scores for the probability of treatment given a set of observed covariates for each unit and construct balanced propensity score strata; we then estimate propensity score stratum-specific average treatment effects and evaluate a trend across them. For the second method, we match control units to treated units based on the propensity score and transform the data into treatment-control comparisons at the most elementary level at which such comparisons can be constructed; we then estimate treatment effects as a function of the propensity score by fitting a nonparametric model as a smoothing device. For the third method, we first estimate nonparametric regressions of the outcome variable as a function of the propensity score separately for treated units and for control units and then take the difference between the two nonparametric regressions. We illustrate the application of these methods with an empirical example of the effects of college attendance on women’s fertility.},

	abstract     = {Often the literature makes assertions of medical product effects on the basis of ‘ p {\textless} 0.05’. The underlying premise is that at this threshold, there is only a 5\% probability that the observed effect would be seen by chance when in reality there is no effect. In observational studies, much more than in randomized trials, bias and confounding may undermine this premise. To test this premise, we selected three exemplar drug safety studies from literature, representing a case–control, a cohort, and a self-controlled case series design. We attempted to replicate these studies as best we could for the drugs studied in the original articles. Next, we applied the same three designs to sets of negative controls: drugs that are not believed to cause the outcome of interest. We observed how often p {\textless} 0.05 when the null hypothesis is true, and we fitted distributions to the effect estimates. Using these distributions, we compute calibrated p-values that reflect the probability of observing the effect estimate under the null hypothesis, taking both random and systematic error into account. An automated analysis of scientific literature was performed to evaluate the potential impact of such a calibration. Our experiment provides evidence that the majority of observational studies would declare statistical significance when no effect is present. Empirical calibration was found to reduce spurious results to the desired 5\% level. Applying these adjustments to literature suggests that at least 54\% of findings with p {\textless} 0.05 are not actually statistically significant and should be reevaluated. © 2013 The Authors.

		Background— Recent proposals suggest that risk-stratified analyses of clinical trials be routinely performed to better enable tailoring of treatment decisions to individuals. Trial data can be stratified using externally developed risk models (eg, Framingham risk score), but such models are not always available. We sought to determine whether internally developed risk models, developed directly on trial data, introduce bias compared with external models.

		Methods and Results— We simulated a large patient population with known risk factors and outcomes. Clinical trials were then simulated by repeatedly drawing from the patient population assuming a specified relative treatment effect in the experimental arm, which either did or did not vary according to a subject’s baseline risk. For each simulated trial, 2 internal risk models were developed on either the control population only (internal controls only) or the whole trial population blinded to treatment (internal whole trial). Bias was estimated for the internal models by comparing treatment effect predictions to predictions from the external model. Under all treatment assumptions, internal models introduced only modest bias compared with external models. The magnitude of these biases was slightly smaller for internal whole trial models than for internal controls only models. Internal whole trial models were also slightly less sensitive to bias introduced by overfitting and less sensitive to falsely identifying the existence of variability in treatment effect across the risk spectrum compared with internal controls only models.

		Conclusions— Appropriately developed internal models produce relatively unbiased estimates of treatment effect across the spectrum of risk. When estimating treatment effect, internally developed risk models using both treatment arms should, in general, be preferred to models developed on the control population.

	abstract     = {Often the literature makes assertions of medical product effects on the basis of ‘ p < 0.05’. The underlying premise is that at this threshold, there is only a 5\% probability that the observed effect would be seen by chance when in reality there is no effect. In observational studies, much more than in randomized trials, bias and confounding may undermine this premise. To test this premise, we selected three exemplar drug safety studies from literature, representing a case–control, a cohort, and a self-controlled case series design. We attempted to replicate these studies as best we could for the drugs studied in the original articles. Next, we applied the same three designs to sets of negative controls: drugs that are not believed to cause the outcome of interest. We observed how often p < 0.05 when the null hypothesis is true, and we fitted distributions to the effect estimates. Using these distributions, we compute calibrated p-values that reflect the probability of observing the effect estimate under the null hypothesis, taking both random and systematic error into account. An automated analysis of scientific literature was performed to evaluate the potential impact of such a calibration. Our experiment provides evidence that the majority of observational studies would declare statistical significance when no effect is present. Empirical calibration was found to reduce spurious results to the desired 5\% level. Applying these adjustments to literature suggests that at least 54\% of findings with p < 0.05 are not actually statistically significant and should be reevaluated. © 2013 The Authors.

		Objectives We conducted a systematic literature review to assess the adverse event (AE) profile of paracetamol.

		Methods We searched Medline and Embase from database inception to 1 May 2013. We screened for observational studies in English, which reported mortality, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (GI) or renal AEs in the general adult population at standard analgesic doses of paracetamol. Study quality was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Pooled or adjusted summary statistics were presented for each outcome.

		Results Of 1888 studies retrieved, 8 met inclusion criteria, and all were cohort studies. Comparing paracetamol use versus no use, of two studies reporting mortality one showed a dose–response and reported an increased relative rate of mortality from 0.95 (0.92 to 0.98) to 1.63 (1.58 to 1.68). Of four studies reporting cardiovascular AEs, all showed a dose–response with one reporting an increased risk ratio of all cardiovascular AEs from 1.19 (0.81 to 1.75) to 1.68 (1.10 to 2.57). One study reporting GI AEs reported a dose–response with increased relative rate of GI AEs or bleeds from 1.11 (1.04 to 1.18) to 1.49 (1.34 to 1.66). Of four studies reporting renal AEs, three reported a dose–response with one reporting an increasing OR of ≥30\% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from 1.40 (0.79 to 2.48) to 2.19 (1.4 to 3.43).

		Discussion Given the observational nature of the data, channelling bias may have had an important impact. However, the dose–response seen for most endpoints suggests a considerable degree of paracetamol toxicity especially at the upper end of standard analgesic doses.

	abstract     = {We evaluated the prevalence of osteoporosis using the osteoporosis diagnostic criteria developed by the National Bone Health Alliance (NBHA), which includes qualified fractures, FRAX score in addition to bone mineral density (BMD). The expanded definition increases the prevalence compared to BMD alone definitions; however, it may better identify those at elevated fracture risk. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to estimate the prevalence of osteoporosis in US adults ≥50 years using the NBHA osteoporosis diagnostic criteria. METHODS: Utilizing 2005-2008 data of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we identified participants with osteoporosis with any one of the following: (1) femoral neck or lumbar spine T-score ≤ -2.5; (2) low trauma hip fracture irrespective of BMD or clinical vertebral, proximal humerus, pelvis, or distal forearm fracture with a T-score {\textgreater}-2.5 {\textless}-1.0; or (3) FRAX score at the National Osteoporosis Foundation intervention thresholds (≥3\% for hip fracture or ≥20\% for major osteoporotic fracture). We estimated the prevalence overall and by gender and age. RESULTS: Our sample included 1948 (54.3\%) men and 1639 (45.7\%) women. Approximately 12\% were 80+ years and 21\% were from racial/ethnic minority groups. We estimated that 16.0\% (0.8) of men and 29.9\% (1.0) of women 50+ years have osteoporosis. The prevalence increases with age to 46.3\% in men and 77.1\% in women 80+ years. The combination of FRAX score and fractures was the largest contributing factor defining osteoporosis in men (70-79, 88.1\%; 80+, 80.1\%), whereas T-score was the largest contributing factor in women (70-79, 49.2\%; 80+, 43.5\%). CONCLUSIONS: We found that 16\% of men and 29.9\% of women 50+ have osteoporosis based on the NBHA diagnostic criteria. Although the expanded definition increases the prevalence compared to BMD alone-based definitions, it may better identify those at elevated fracture risk in order to reduce the burden of fractures in older adults.},

		Abstract

		Objective To develop a conceptual prediction model framework containing standardized steps and describe the corresponding open-source software developed to consistently implement the framework across computational environments and observational healthcare databases to enable model sharing and reproducibility.

		Methods Based on existing best practices we propose a 5 step standardized framework for: (1) transparently defining the problem; (2) selecting suitable datasets; (3) constructing variables from the observational data; (4) learning the predictive model; and (5) validating the model performance. We implemented this framework as open-source software utilizing the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model to enable convenient sharing of models and reproduction of model evaluation across multiple observational datasets. The software implementation contains default covariates and classifiers but the framework enables customization and extension.

		Results As a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the transparency and ease of model dissemination using the software, we developed prediction models for 21 different outcomes within a target population of people suffering from depression across 4 observational databases. All 84 models are available in an accessible online repository to be implemented by anyone with access to an observational database in the Common Data Model format.

		Conclusions The proof-of-concept study illustrates the framework’s ability to develop reproducible models that can be readily shared and offers the potential to perform extensive external validation of models, and improve their likelihood of clinical uptake. In future work the framework will be applied to perform an “all-by-all” prediction analysis to assess the observational data prediction domain across numerous target populations, outcomes and time, and risk settings.

Reliable frameworks are needed to determine relative propensity score performance in large-scale studies, and to establish optimal propensity score model selection methods.We detail a propensity score evaluation framework that includes synthetic and real-world data experiments. Our synthetic experimental design extends the ‘plasmode’ framework and simulates survival data under known effect sizes, and our real-world experiments use a set of negative control outcomes with presumed null effect sizes. In reproductions of two published cohort studies, we compare two propensity score estimation methods that contrast in their model selection approach: L1-regularized regression that conducts a penalized likelihood regression, and the ‘high-dimensional propensity score’ (hdPS) that employs a univariate covariate screen. We evaluate methods on a range of outcome-dependent and outcome-independent metrics.L1-regularization propensity score methods achieve superior model fit, covariate balance and negative control bias reduction compared with the hdPS. Simulation results are mixed and fluctuate with simulation parameters, revealing a limitation of simulation under the proportional hazards framework. Including regularization with the hdPS reduces commonly reported non-convergence issues but has little effect on propensity score performance.L1-regularization incorporates all covariates simultaneously into the propensity score model and offers propensity score performance superior to the hdPS marginal screen.},

Observational studies have often been found to be nonreproducible, however, generating conflicting results even when using the same database to answer the same question. One source of discrepancies is error, both random caused by sampling variability and systematic (for example, because of confounding, selection bias, and measurement error). Only random error is typically quantified but converges to zero as databases become larger, whereas systematic error persists independent from sample size and therefore, increases in relative importance. Negative controls are exposure{\textendash}outcome pairs, where one believes no causal effect exists; they can be used to detect multiple sources of systematic error, but interpreting their results is not always straightforward. Previously, we have shown that an empirical null distribution can be derived from a sample of negative controls and used to calibrate P values, accounting for both random and systematic error. Here, we extend this work to calibration of confidence intervals (CIs). CIs require positive controls, which we synthesize by modifying negative controls. We show that our CI calibration restores nominal characteristics, such as 95\% coverage of the true effect size by the 95\% CI. We furthermore show that CI calibration reduces disagreement in replications of two pairs of conflicting observational studies: one related to dabigatran, warfarin, and gastrointestinal bleeding and one related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We recommend CI calibration to improve reproducibility of observational studies.},

We compared the anti-fracture efficacy of teriparatide with risedronate in patients with severe osteoporosis. Methods In this double-blind, double-dummy trial, we enrolled post-menopausal women with at least two moderate or one severe vertebral fracture and a bone mineral density T score of less than or equal to −1·50. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 20 μg of teriparatide once daily plus oral weekly placebo or 35 mg of oral risedronate once weekly plus daily injections of placebo for 24 months. The primary outcome was new radiographic vertebral fractures. Secondary, gated outcomes included new and worsened radiographic vertebral fractures, clinical fractures (a composite of non-vertebral and symptomatic vertebral), and non-vertebral fractures. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01709110) and EudraCT (2012-000123-41). Findings We enrolled 680 patients in each group. At 24 months, new vertebral fractures occurred in 28 (5·4\%) of 680 patients in the teriparatide group and 64 (12·0\%) of 680 patients in the risedronate group (risk ratio 0·44, 95\% CI 0·29–0·68; p{\textless}0·0001). Clinical fractures occurred in 30 (4·8\%) of 680 patients in the teriparatide group compared with 61 (9·8\%) of 680 in the risedronate group (hazard ratio 0·48, 95\% CI 0·32–0·74; p=0·0009). Non-vertebral fragility fractures occurred in 25 (4·0\%) patients in the teriparatide group and 38 (6·1\%) in the risedronate group (hazard ratio 0·66; 95\% CI 0·39–1·10; p=0·10). Interpretation Among post-menopausal women with severe osteoporosis, the risk of new vertebral and clinical fractures is significantly lower in patients receiving teriparatide than in those receiving risedronate.

	abstract     = {The phase 3 teriparatide Fracture Prevention Trial showed significant reductions in vertebral (VF) and nonvertebral (NVF) fractures; however, patient exposure was insufficient for full analysis of low-incidence fractures, including hip. We assessed fracture results in pooled data from four prospective, observational teriparatide studies. Ambulatory women and men with osteoporosis received subcutaneous teriparatide 20 µg/day for up to 24 months per routine clinical practice. Fracture rates were compared between 6-month periods, using 0 to 6 months of treatment as the reference period. Analyses used a piecewise exponential model for first fracture. Hip, NVF, clinical VF (CVF), any clinical, and wrist fractures were assessed. For 8828 patients analyzed, mean age was 71 years; mean (SD) treatment duration was 17.4 (8.6) months. The rate of hip fracture decreased significantly for the {\textgreater} 12 to 18-month (− 47.7\%) and {\textgreater} 18-month periods (-85.2\%) versus the first 6 months of therapy, and for the {\textgreater} 18 versus the {\textgreater} 6 to 12-month period. NVF, CVF, and all clinical fractures were all significantly decreased in each post-reference period, with maximum decreases ({\textgreater} 18-month period) of 52.7\%, 69.4\%, and 61.2\%, respectively, versus 0 to 6 months. No significant reduction was seen for rates of wrist fracture. Teriparatide treatment was associated with statistically significant decreases in hip fracture rate, particularly for {\textgreater} 18 months of treatment, and in NVF, CVF, and all clinical fracture rate in real-world patients. These results should be interpreted in the context of the non-controlled design of the source studies.},

		Concerns over reproducibility in science extend to research using existing healthcare data; many observational studies investigating the same topic produce conflicting results, even when using the same data. To address this problem, we propose a paradigm shift. The current paradigm centres on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time. The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base. We demonstrate this new paradigm by comparing all depression treatments for a set of outcomes, producing 17 718 hazard ratios, each using methodology on par with current best practice. We furthermore include control hypotheses to evaluate and calibrate our evidence generation process. Results show good transitivity and consistency between databases, and agree with four out of the five findings from clinical trials. The distribution of effect size estimates reported in the literature reveals an absence of small or null effects, with a sharp cut-off at p = 0.05. No such phenomena were observed in our results, suggesting more complete and more reliable evidence.

The goal of predictive HTE analysis is to provide patient-centered estimates of outcome risk with versus without the intervention, taking into account all relevant patient attributes simultaneously, to support more personalized clinical decision making than can be made on the basis of only an overall average treatment effect. The authors distinguished 2 categories of predictive HTE approaches (a “risk-modeling” and an “effect-modeling” approach) and developed 4 sets of guidance statements: criteria to determine when risk-modeling approaches are likely to identify clinically meaningful HTE, methodological aspects of risk-modeling methods, considerations for translation to clinical practice, and considerations and caveats in the use of effect-modeling approaches. They discuss limitations of these methods and enumerate research priorities for advancing methods designed to generate more personalized evidence.

	abstract     = {In randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with teriparatide, the number of patients with incident hip fractures was small and insufficiently powered to show statistically significant differences between groups. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of teriparatide in the reduction of hip and upper limb fractures in women and men with osteoporosis. A comprehensive search of databases until 22 November 2017 was conducted for RCTs of at least 6-month duration that reported non-spine fractures (hip, humerus, forearm, wrist), either as an efficacy or safety endpoint. Only RCTs that included patients with the approved treatment indications and dose for use of teriparatide were included; trials with off-label use of teriparatide were excluded. Two independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction. Statistical procedures included Peto's method and Mantel-Haenszel with empirical correction, as most of the RCTs reported zero events in at least one of the treatment arms. Study results are expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Publication bias and heterogeneity were evaluated with standard statistical tests. Twenty-three RCTs were included, 19 with an active-controlled arm (representing 64.9\% of the patients included in the control group) and 11 double-blind, representing data on 8644 subjects, 3893 of them treated with teriparatide. Mean age (SD) was 67.0 (4.5) years, median treatment duration 18 months (range: 6 to 24 months). A total of 34 incident hip, 31 humerus, 31 forearm, and 62 wrist fractures were included. Meta-analysis results showed an OR (95\% CI) for hip fractures of 0.44 (0.22–0.87; p = 0.019) in patients treated with teriparatide compared with controls. The effects on the risk of humerus [1.02 (0.50–2.08)], forearm [0.53 (0.26–1.08)] and wrist fractures [1.21 (0.72–2.04)] were not statistically significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05).

		Abstract

		Background Recent evidence suggests that there is often substantial variation in the benefits and harms across a trial population. We aimed to identify regression modeling approaches that assess heterogeneity of treatment effect within a randomized clinical trial.

		Methods We performed a literature review using a broad search strategy, complemented by suggestions of a technical expert panel.

		Results The approaches are classified into 3 categories: 1) Risk-based methods (11 papers) use only prognostic factors to define patient subgroups, relying on the mathematical dependency of the absolute risk difference on baseline risk; 2) Treatment effect modeling methods (9 papers) use both prognostic factors and treatment effect modifiers to explore characteristics that interact with the effects of therapy on a relative scale. These methods couple data-driven subgroup identification with approaches to prevent overfitting, such as penalization or use of separate data sets for subgroup identification and effect estimation. 3) Optimal treatment regime methods (12 papers) focus primarily on treatment effect modifiers to classify the trial population into those who benefit from treatment and those who do not. Finally, we also identified papers which describe model evaluation methods (4 papers).

		Conclusions Three classes of approaches were identified to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect. Methodological research, including both simulations and empirical evaluations, is required to compare the available methods in different settings and to derive well-informed guidance for their application in RCT analysis.

	abstract     = {BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effects and safety of teriparatide with risedronate in the treatment of osteoporosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane library database were systematically reviewed for studies published up to February 24, 2019. Eligible studies that compared the effects of teriparatide with risedronate in osteoporosis were included in this meta-analysis. The outcomes included percentage change in bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip, the incidence of clinical fractures, serum bone markers, and adverse events. A random-effects or fixed-effects model was used to pool the estimate, according to the heterogeneity among the included studies. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with risedronate, teriparatide was associated with a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD [weight mean difference (WMD)=4.24, 95\%CI: 3.11, 5.36; P {\textless} .001], femoral neck BMD (WMD=2.28, 95\%CI: 1.39, 3.18; P {\textless} .001), and total hip BMD (WMD = 1.19, 95\%CI: 0.47, 1.91; P = .001). Moreover, patients in teriparatide group had significantly lower incidences of clinical fracture (risk ratio [RR] = 0.48, 95\%CI: 0.32, 0.72; P {\textless} .001), new vertebral fracture (RR = 0.45, 95\%CI: 0.32, 0.63; P {\textless} .001), and non-vertebral fracture (RR = 0.63, 95\%CI: 0.40, 0.98; P = .042) than those in risedronate group. There were significant differences between the 2 groups in serum change, including P1NP (WMD = 122.34, 95\%CI: 68.89, 175.99; P {\textless} .001), CTx (WMD = 0.62, 95\%CI: 0.29, 0.96; P {\textless} .001), and iPTH (WMD = -13.18, 95\%CI: -15.04, -11.33; P {\textless} .001). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the 2 groups (RR = 0.93, 95\%CI: 0.69, 1.25; P = .610). CONCLUSION: This study suggested that teriparatide was more effective than risedronate for increasing the BMD in lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip, as well as reducing the incidences of clinical fracture, new vertebral fracture and non-vertebral fracture. There was no significant difference in incidence of adverse events between the 2 drugs. Considering the potential limitations in the present study, further large-scale, well-performed randomized trials are needed to verify our findings.},

Methods: Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of the clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors, according to established AACE/ACE guidelines for guidelines protocols. Results: The Executive Summary of this 2020 updated guideline contains 52 recommendations: 21 Grade A (40\%), 24 Grade B (46\%), 7 Grade C (14\%), and no Grade D (0\%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuance-based clinical decision-making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world care of patients. The evidence base presented in the subsequent Appendix provides relevant supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations. This update contains 368 citations: 123 (33.5\%) evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 132 (36\%) EL 2 (intermediate), 20 (5.5\%) EL 3 (weak), and 93 (25\%) EL 4 (lowest). New or updated topics in this CPG include: clarification of the diagnosis of osteoporosis, stratification of the patient according to high-risk and very-high-risk features, a new dual-action therapy option, and transitions from therapeutic options. Conclusion: This guideline is a practical tool for endocrinologists, physicians in general, regulatory bodies, health-related organizations, and interested laypersons regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis.},

	abstract     = {PURPOSE: In contrast to randomized clinical trials, comparative safety and effectiveness assessments of osteoporosis medications in clinical practice may be subject to confounding by indication. We used negative control outcomes to detect residual confounding when comparing osteoporosis medications. METHODS: Using MarketScan Commercial and Supplemental claims, we identified women aged ≥55 years who initiated an oral bisphosphonate (BP) (risedronate, alendronate, or ibandronate), denosumab (an injected biologic), or intravenous zoledronic acid (ZA) from October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2015. Women with Paget's disease or cancer were excluded. We compared individual oral BPs to each other, denosumab to ZA, denosumab to oral BPs, and ZA to oral BPs, with respect to 11 negative control outcomes identified by subject matter experts. We estimated the 12-month cumulative risk difference (RD) using inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights. RESULTS: Among 148 587 women, most initiated alendronate (57\%), followed by ibandronate (12\%), ZA (11\%), risedronate (10\%), and denosumab (10\%). Compared with denosumab, patients initiating ZA had similar risks of all negative control outcomes. Compared with oral BPs, patients initiating denosumab had a higher risk of a wellness visit (RD = 1.2\%, 95\% CI: 0.4, 1.9) and a lower risk of receiving herpes zoster vaccine (RD = -0.6\%, 95\% CI: -1.1, -0.2). Comparing ZA with oral BP initiators resulted in two outcomes with positive associations. CONCLUSIONS: Caution is warranted when comparing injectable vs oral osteoporosis medications, given the potential for unmeasured confounding. Evaluating negative control outcomes could be a standard validity check prior to conducting comparative studies.},

In particular, we introduce two novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting. The robustness value describes the minimum strength of association that unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the treatment and with the outcome, to change the research conclusions. The partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual outcome variation would have to be associated with the treatment to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools for elaborating on problematic confounders, examining the sensitivity of point estimates and t-values, as well as ‘extreme scenarios’. Finally, we describe problems with a common ‘benchmarking’ practice and introduce a novel procedure to bound the strength of confounders formally on the basis of a comparison with observed covariates. We apply these methods to a running example that estimates the effect of exposure to violence on attitudes toward peace.},
